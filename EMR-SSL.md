# SSL/TLS on Amazon EMR
To implement a trust store and key store for securing communications with SSL/TLS on Amazon EMR, you would typically go through the process of creating and configuring these keystores. This setup ensures that data transmitted to and from your EMR cluster is encrypted and secure. Here are the steps you would typically follow:

## Step 1: Create a Key Pair and a Self-Signed Certificate
First, you need to create a key pair and a certificate. This can be done using tools like OpenSSL.
```bash
# Generate a private key
openssl genrsa -out my-private-key.pem 2048

# Create a self-signed certificate
openssl req -new -x509 -key my-private-key.pem -out my-certificate.pem -days 365
```
## Step 2: Create a Java Key Store (JKS)
Convert the certificate and key into a format that Java applications can use, such as a Java Key Store (JKS).

```bash
# Import the key and certificate to a new keystore
keytool -importkeystore \
        -srckeystore my-private-key.pem \
        -destkeystore my-keystore.jks \
        -srcstoretype PKCS12 \
        -deststoretype JKS \
        -srcstorepass changeit \
        -deststorepass changeit \
        -srcalias 1 \
        -destalias mykey \
        -srckeypass changeit \
        -destkeypass changeit \
        -noprompt
```
## Step 3: Create a Trust Store
A trust store is used to store certificates from trusted entities. You can add any certificates you trust, including your own if you are using self-signed certificates.
```bash
# Import your certificate or CA's certificate to a new trust store
keytool -import -file my-certificate.pem -alias mycert -keystore my-truststore.jks -storepass changeit -noprompt
```
## Step 4: Configure SSL/TLS in EMR
After creating the key store and trust store, you need to configure your EMR cluster to use these files for SSL/TLS encryption.

- Edit the emrfs-site configuration for Amazon S3 encryption:
```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.s3.cse.enabled</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>fs.s3.cse.encryptionMaterialsProvider.uri</name>
  <value>emrfs:///emr-kms-s3.json</value>
</property>
```
- Set up encryption for data in transit by modifying the Spark and Hadoop settings to use the SSL properties pointing to your keystore and truststore files. This can be configured through the EMR console when creating a cluster or via a configuration JSON when using the AWS CLI or SDK.
```json
[
  {
    "Classification": "spark-defaults",
    "Properties": {
      "spark.ssl.enabled": "true",
      "spark.ssl.trustStore": "/path/to/my-truststore.jks",
      "spark.ssl.trustStorePassword": "changeit",
      "spark.ssl.keyStore": "/path/to/my-keystore.jks",
      "spark.ssl.keyStorePassword": "changeit"
    }
  },
  {
    "Classification": "hadoop-env",
    "Properties": {
      "HADOOP_OPTS": "\"-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/my-truststore.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/path/to/my-keystore.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=changeit\""
    }
  }
]
```
## Final Steps
- Securely upload your keystore and truststore files to a secure location on your EMR cluster, typically in the /etc/pki/tls directory or a directory specified in your Hadoop and Spark SSL configurations.
- Restart your Hadoop and Spark services to apply these changes.
<p>This setup ensures that your EMR cluster can securely communicate using SSL/TLS, protecting your data in transit. Always keep your keys and certificates secure, and rotate them periodically to maintain the security integrity of your system.</p>
