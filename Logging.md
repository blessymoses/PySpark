# Logging

## Logging Implementation - Using logback
- 3 main components:
1. loggers: Responsible for capturing logging information.
2. appenders: Responsible for publishing logging information to various preferred destinations.
3. layouts: Responsible for formatting logging information in different styles.

- The target or destination of log output as well as the writing strategy can be modified by switching implementations of the Appender interface.
